- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmsk01
- 👀 I’m interested in self-development. As the main direction/activity/hobby I've chosen web-development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script Electron, Node JS and React. In the future I plan to become JS Fullstack engineer or Frontend software developer(I have not decided yet - too much cool technologies and too little time).
- 💞️ First I’m looking to collaborate in some project on junior position. Work hard and then to improve my skill in the stack.
- 📫 Some day, I hope, I will work full time as senior developer and do the magic)
